Installation
------------

1. Unzip the distribution.

   This should extract the files listed in the manifest above.

2. Copy the .el files to your emacs site-lisp directory (e.g.,
   /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp). Or copy them into a subdirectory
   of your site-lisp directory and add that subdirectory to your
   load path.

3. Byte compile the .el files using M-x byte-compile-file and
   supplying the path name of each file.

   If you byte-compiled a previous version of the files, you must
   byte-compile the new files (or remove the old .elc files) so that
   autoload loads the correct versions.

4. Add the elisp code in dot_emacs to your .emacs file.

5. If you associate docbook-mode with an extension, it will automatically
   be loaded when you visit files with that extension. Alternatively,
   you may use <!-- -*- DocBook -*- --> on the first line of your documents,
   or use buffer-local variables to associate DocBook mode with your
   documents.
